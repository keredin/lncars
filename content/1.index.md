You can be assured that our drivers provide an excellent level of customer service. Our drivers are licenced by South Cambridgeshire District Council which requires they must have held a UK Driving Licence for a minimum period of one year. The drivers also need to have passed a full medical examination, an Enhanced DBS check and an additional DSA Driving Test.
